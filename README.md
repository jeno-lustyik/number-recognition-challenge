#### Introduction
The Idea behind this project is to predict the hand written digits of a user by CNN model.  
We trained the model with available MNIST dataset in the torchvision library.
We defined a Image preprocess function that takes hand written image from the user and preprocess it.
The preprocessed image will act as input to our model for prediction.

#### What to Install
pip install -requirements.txt

#### How to use it
1. First Install the required packages.
2. There was a folder named images to place your hand written digit images.
3. Run `main.py` file.
4. It gonna ask you image input in the terminal.
5. Enter the image name to be predicted with extension.
6. In the end it gonna give you, your input image and the predicted output.
